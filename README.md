# KEGG_fetch
README

Scripts to fetch KEGG latest data and organize it into tabular format.

## Getting Started

These scripts allow you to download data from the KEGG database using their API. The data can be downloaded and organized into a tabular format for easy analysis. 

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, you will need to have Python 3 and the requests module installed on your system. To install requests, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install requests
```

### Running the Scripts

To run the scripts, simply navigate to the directory where the scripts are saved and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This will initiate the script and download the latest data from KEGG. 

### Output

The output of the script will be saved in a tabular format in a folder named as "current" date.
